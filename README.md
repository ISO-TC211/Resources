Maintenance, terms of reference and discussions about resources for implementation of ISO/TC211 standards

Background:
# Resolution 857 Official web access for ISO/TC 211 resources to support implementation of standards
ISO/TC 211 resolves to use isotc211.org for web access to its official resources that support implementation, including but not limited to, XML Implementation Schemas, XML Codelists, XML Example files, Ontologies, UML XMI files, Terminologies and Profiles of standards.

# Resolution 858 ISO/TC 211 URI structure
ISO/TC 211 resolves that all identifiable conformance classes, conformance tests, requirements and recommendations in ISO geographic information standards shall be identified by URIs with a given structure.
ISO/TC 211 instructs the convenors of TMG, XMG, GOM, PMG and HMMG to develop the structure of the URIs and web resources in a draft report lead by Mr. Knut Jetlund. The report will be sent to the ISO/TC 211 secretariat for distribution to its members one month before the next plenary meeting. Once accepted, this report will be an input to the revision of 19105.

# Resolution 859 ISO/TC 211 Maintenance groups structure
Considering the challenge of managing implementation resources ISO/TC 211 instructs the convenors of the TMG, XMG, GOM, PMG and HMMG, lead by Mr. Knut Jetlund, to discuss the current structure of the groups and, if a change is preferable, propose a way forward. The agreed proposal shall be presented at the next plenary meeting.
